# Iris-Flower-Classification-Deep-Learning


## Overview

This repository contains code for a simple Iris flower classification deep learning model. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it classifies Iris flowers into different species based on their features.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Anaconda (optional but recommended for managing environments)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-classification-deep-learning.git
   cd iris-classification-deep-learning
  ´´´
  
## Dataset
The Iris dataset is used for training and testing the model. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file (iris.csv) and contains features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Code Structure
iris_classification.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.

## Usage
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook iris_classification.ipynb in your Jupyter environment.

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
